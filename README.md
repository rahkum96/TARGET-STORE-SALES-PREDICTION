The company also runs several promotional  markdown events throughout the year. These markdowns precede prominent holidays, the  four largest of which are the Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.

### Problem description: 
One challenge of modeling retail data is the need to make decisions based on limited history. Holidays and select major events come once a year, and so does the chance to see how strategic decisions impacted the bottom line. In addition, markdowns are known to affect sales the challenge is to predict which departments will be affected and to what extent.
